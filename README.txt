*CONTENT*

Content of this archive is as follows:

    - 13_OOP - OOP examples - HIGHLY recommended, since they follow a logical learning path in OOP Python programming.
    - 14_UnitTesting - several unit testing examples
    - 15_DataVisualization - several data visualization examples
    - 16_Network - several network request/response examples
    - tasks.txt - 50 exercise tasks in Python, written from least to most complex ones
    - Exercises - solutions for tasks.txt
    - utils - contains json_server.py, a small HTTP server that you will need to solve some of the exercises dealing with network requests

I suggest that you use the content as follows:

    (1) Work out through 13_OOP in detail
    (2) Also try to complete 14_UnitTesting, 15_DataVisualization and 16_Network
    (3) Open tasks.txt and start with easy exercises. 
        Progress upwards. 
        You can skip an exercise if you believe that it's too easy for you.
        You can open task solution from the Exercises folder if you consider a task too complex or you just need a hand.

*NETWORK EXERCISES AND JSON SERVER*

Note that when you reach the network exercises (ex_32 and higher), you will have to start json_server.py in a 
separate shell or console. 
You can either:
(1) start the json_server.py from cmd (python json_server.py), or 
(2) switch to python terminal in VS Code and start server using that terminal...
    python .\utils\json_server.py
To make sure the server is working properly, open the address exposed by the server in browser. 
The address will be displayed when the server starts, something like http://127.0.0.1:8888/.
HINT: if you change the data hosted by the server (e.g. by POST, PUT or DELETE), you can always restart the server 
and data will be reset.
